% CMD..

Manage a pool of active job slots, which is available to executed CMD and children.

Options:
    --new[=N]               create new pool with N initial slots
    --fixed[=N]             --new[=N] without monitoring

(note: N can be specified, but it should seldom be needed!)

    --no-makeflags          don't modify/create $MAKEFLAGS
