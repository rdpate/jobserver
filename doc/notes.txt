    * "jobserver export" saves FDs for later "jobserver import CMD.."
* notes
    * GNU Make 4.1 (and probably others) requires blocking FDs, as tested by:
        > mkfifo pipe
        > printf xx >>pipe &
        > exec 3<pipe 4>>pipe
        > export MAKE_FLAGS=' -j --jobserver-fds=3,4'
        > # Makefile contains 4 parallel "sleep 1" phony targets
        > time make
        > # set &3 non-blocking
        > time make
        > # make: *** read jobs pipe: Resource temporarily unavailable.  Stop.
    * blocking IO complicates shared file descriptors under contention
        * if read_fd is ready, as indicated by poll or select, then immediately after, it may still block indefinitely
