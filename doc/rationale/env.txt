* JOBSERVER_FDS
    * determines whether (this) Jobserver is active, if those are valid FDs

* MAKEFLAGS
    * add JOBSERVER_FDS to MAKEFLAGS with "jobserver makeflags"
        * make and other tools (which might be ignorant of Jobserver) can use them
    * always read FDs from JOBSERVER_FDS, never from MAKEFLAGS
        * simpler, more predictable -- in the sense of a protocol implemented multiple times in multiple languages
